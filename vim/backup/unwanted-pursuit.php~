                                            <p>"Cyberbullying" is when a minor child, preteen or teen is tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another minor child, preteen or teen using the Internet, interactive and digital technologies or mobile phones. </p>

                                            <header><h3>Textual-Harassment</h3></header>

                                            <header><h3>Blogs</h3></header>
                                            <p>Blogs are online journals. They are a fun way for kids and teens to send messages for all of their friends to see. However, kids sometimes use these blogs to damage other kids' reputations or invade their privacy. For example, in one case, a boy posted a bunch of blogs about his breakup with his ex-girlfriend, explaining how she destroyed his life, calling her degrading names. Their mutual friends read about this and criticized her. She was embarrassed and hurt, all because another kid posted mean, private, and false information about her.</p>

                                            <p>Many of the newer cell phones allow kids to send pictures to each other. The kids receive the pictures directly on their phones, and may send it to everyone in their address books.  Kids often take a picture of someone in a locker room, bathroom or dressing room and post it online or send it to others on cell phones. </p>
                                            <header><h3>Internet Polling</h3></header>
                                            <p>Who's Hot? Who's Not? These types of questions run rampant on the Internet polls, all created by teens. Such questions are often very offensive to others and are yet another way that teens can "bully" other teens online. </p>
                                            <header><h3>Sending Malicious Code </h3></header>
                                            <p>Many kids will send viruses, spyware and hacking programs to their victims. They do this to either destroy their computers or spy on their victim.
