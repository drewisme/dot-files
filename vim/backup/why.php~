toward me . . . . I kept telling him to leave me alone, looking
down. When I didn't react to him, he grabbed me by my wrists
and dragged me to his car. By this time, everyone was walking
by on their way to school. Buses and teachers were driving up.
My last hope was to yell for help . . . . I started calling, "Help
me!" He started slapping me. I kept screaming for help. He
grabbed from behind and put his hands over my nose and
mouth. I couldn't breathe . . . . The last thing I saw was about
twenty or twenty-five of my classmates standing within a few
yards of me, just watching.</em></p>
